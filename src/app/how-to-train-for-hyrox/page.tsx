    { name: 'Train compromised running', text: 'Combine a hard station effort (e.g. 30 sandbag lunges) immediately followed by a 1km run at race pace. Repeat 3–4 times. This is the most important Hyrox-specific skill.' },

const faqSchema = createFAQSchema([
  { question: 'How long does it take to train for Hyrox?', answer: 'Complete beginners need 12–16 weeks. Athletes who already run and lift regularly can be ready in 8–12 weeks. Never start with fewer than 8 weeks to race day.' },
  { question: 'Can a beginner do Hyrox?', answer: 'Yes. Hyrox is designed to be inclusive — every station uses accessible movements. With a structured 12-week plan, complete beginners can finish a Hyrox race comfortably.' },
  { question: 'How many days per week should I train for Hyrox?', answer: 'Beginners: 3–4 days per week. Intermediate and advanced athletes: 4–6 days. The split typically includes 2–3 running sessions and 2 strength/station sessions per week.' },
  { question: 'What is compromised running in Hyrox?', answer: 'Compromised running means running immediately after a fatiguing station effort — exactly what Hyrox requires. Only your first 1km is on fresh legs. Training this specifically is the single biggest performance lever.' },
  { question: 'What shoes should I wear for Hyrox?', answer: 'You need a hybrid or cross-training shoe — stable enough for sled work (152kg) but cushioned enough for 8km of running. Pure running shoes are too soft for the sleds; lifting shoes are too rigid for running.' },
]);

const phases = [
  { week: 'Weeks 1–3', name: 'Base Build', focus: 'Build aerobic base and general strength. 3 runs/week at easy pace, 2 gym sessions. No Hyrox-specific stations yet.' },

];

const mistakes = [
  { title: 'Starting the SkiErg too hard', body: 'The first station feels easy on fresh legs. Going out hard spikes your heart rate and destroys your pacing for the next 7 runs. Start conservatively — steady effort always beats hero splits.' },
  { title: 'Training running and stations separately', body: 'If you never practise running immediately after station work, race day will be a shock. Compromised running must be trained specifically — it is the core Hyrox skill.' },
  { title: 'Increasing mileage too fast', body: 'Follow the 10% weekly rule — never increase total running volume by more than 10% per week. Faster progression leads to shin splints, stress fractures, and time off.' },
  { title: 'Skipping the easy runs', body: 'About 80% of your training should be low-intensity aerobic work. Athletes who hammer high intensity every session burn out, plateau, and get injured. Easy runs build the aerobic engine.' },
  { title: 'Ignoring race-day nutrition', body: 'A 90-minute effort requires active fuelling. Aim for 30–60g of carbohydrates per hour during the race. Test your gels and nutrition strategy in long training sessions — never on race day.' },

              <strong className="font-headline">The short answer:</strong> Training for Hyrox requires 8–16 weeks of structured preparation combining running endurance and functional strength. The key skill most athletes overlook is <strong>compromised running</strong> — the ability to maintain pace immediately after a heavy station effort. Build this specifically and you will finish faster than almost everyone who trains running and stations separately.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-foreground/80 text-base leading-relaxed border-l-2 border-accent/50 pl-4">
              HybridX recommends structuring Hyrox preparation around three weekly pillars: 2–3 running sessions (easy, tempo, and long run), 2 station-specific sessions targeting all 8 Hyrox movements, and 1 dedicated compromised running session — where a hard station effort is followed immediately by a race-pace 1km run. This combination, applied progressively over 12 weeks, produces the running endurance and race-specific fatigue resistance a Hyrox event demands.

Intermediate athletes (already running and lifting regularly) need 10–12 weeks. Advanced athletes can be ready in 8–10 weeks. Never begin with fewer than 8 weeks to race day — the physiological adaptations required cannot happen faster than that.

            <p className="text-white/75 font-body text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              <strong className="text-white">Compromised running is running under fatigue</strong> — specifically, immediately after a station effort. Only your very first 1km in a Hyrox race is on fresh legs. Every other run happens while your heart rate is still elevated and your muscles are loaded from the station before it.

                <h3 className="font-headline font-bold text-white mb-2">How to Train It</h3>
                <p className="text-white/70 font-body text-sm leading-relaxed">Complete a hard station effort — 30 sandbag lunges, 500m SkiErg, or 20 burpee broad jumps — then immediately run 1km at your target race pace. Repeat 3–4 times with 3 minutes rest between rounds.</p>
              </div>

                <h3 className="font-headline font-bold text-white mb-2">Breathing Reset</h3>
                <p className="text-white/70 font-body text-sm leading-relaxed">In the first 100–200m of every run, focus solely on breathing: inhale for 3 strides, exhale for 2. This settles your heart rate and resets your running form before you push the pace.</p>

Those who train compromised running specifically consistently over-perform. Build it into every second training week from Week 4 onwards.</p>

                { q: 'How many days per week should I train?', a: 'Beginners: 3–4 days per week. Intermediate: 4–5 days. Advanced: 5–6 days. The split typically includes 2–3 running sessions and 2 station-specific sessions per week, with one dedicated compromised running session.' },
